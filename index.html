          <p class="mb-8">
            I'm a senior software engineer based in Toronto, Canada. Interests
            include geopolitics, minimalism, long distance running, virtual
            power, and raining triples on my enemies in basketball. I used to
            play guitar but I live in a condo now so that's on hold.

            I currently work on the US-based domestic asset integrations team,
            which is a fancy term for the team that connects with customer
            residential energy assets such as home batteries, solar panels, and
            EVs. We then abstract them behind a virtual power plant API
            consumable by electricity system operators. When I lived in the UK,
            I worked for the core optimisation team which used Python and it's
            myriad of data science libraries the find the mathematically optimal
            way to dispatch and control the aforementioned assets. By
            mathematically optimal, I mean most profitable ü§≠.

            My first job after moving to the UK, Limejump is an award-winning
            pioneer in the virtual energy space. I lead the billing team,
            responsible for aggragating customer contract and meter data, then
            crunching the numbers into a sendable invoice. In 2019, I did a
            secondment as an Energy Trader at our in-house energy trading desk,
            where I traded power from our commissioned energy assets on the EPEX
            intraday and day-ahead energy markets. Also in 2019, Limejump was
            acquired by Shell and incorporated into the Shell New Energies
            department, which coincidentally was the day I discovered my love of
            employee option grants.

            I have a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Economics and minor in

            Entering university I wanted to be a lawyer, but after reading my
            first apartment lease I decided to find a career path that wouldn't
            make me want to kill myself. After taking courses in nearly
            everything, I discovered that that I liked dealing with numbers and
            that I was good at programming.

            For my bird photographer father's 70 birthday, I made him a simple
            web application to upload, categorize, and display his bird photos.
            I used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and SST to deploy it to AWS. I made
            the whole thing from scratch, which in retrospect was a mistake
            since my design skills are terrible. In true agile fashion, I'll add
            new features once he requires them, which will be probably be never
            because his baby boomer soul rejects new technology like an organ
            transplant.
